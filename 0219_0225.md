### (22/02/2024 - 24/02/2024)
### Introduction && Related word
1. Cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs): Bridge scenarios each other.
2. Kalman filter and graph-based SLAM: The Kalman filter suffers from lower accuracy in comparison to the smoothing‐based integration counterpart.
3. The preintegration based on Lie algebra is still insufficient.
4. point transformations → screw motion theory
### Methods
1. Methodology:
    1) Basic theory on screw motion and unit dual quaternion

    2) IMU algorithm by dual quaternion: Preintegration by replacing Lie algebra with the unit dual quaternion
    3) Noise covariance: Propose the simplicity of conversion and a flexible mapping for noise computing.
    4) Solving for over-parametrization:
        * The screw motion theory
        * Isolate the quaternion in question and simplify it to basic quaternion products.
        * q′ = t ⊗ q
        * Transform the dual part to SE3.
        * Extract the parameters.
    5) Bias correction
2. Optimization in the screw motion theory framework
    1) Error function
    2) Jacobians of the residuals
        * Quaternion error
        * Perturbations of attitude
        * Perturbation of the translation
        * Perturbation of the position
    3) Formulation in an optimized frame
### contribution
1. Unit dual quaternions are employed to construct the graphs’ inertial edges and the states are updated by the screw motion framework.
2. Solve for over-parametrization.
### Advantages and Disadvantages
1. The cost is reduced and the performance is enhanced due to fewer parameters and faster convergence.
### Problem
1. The property of scene reconstruction can be boosted by the screw motion theory, but this paper does not say how to boost it. I need to read the original paper (PLI‐VINS: visual‐inertial SLAM based on point‐line feature fusion in indoor environment)
2. The Quaternion can avoid singularities, but advantages of the unit dual quaternion are not proposed. I need to read the original paper (Strapdown inertial navigation system algorithms based on dual
quaternions)
3. The logic of the paper is clear, but the formulas of IMU preintegration are not derived.
