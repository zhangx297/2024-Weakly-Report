### (25/12/2024 - 03/01/2025)
1. Code rewrite: I first tried to change the Gaussian Newton from point to line and point to surface in the LVI-SAM source code to a ceres factor for the residual construction, but I found that there was no residual function in the source code, so I looked at the code backwards, and finally found that I still could not solve the construction of the residual function. So I was ready to pass the optimisation factors and parameters exported from GVINS to LVI-SAM first to pass the state variables in the optimisation function.

2. Derivation of formulae: 
    1) I first tried to derive the IMU preintegration as in the paper:

    2) I found that the preintegration is derived Jacobi using the perturbation model, but the other factors are derived from the way the derivatives are defined, so this method is not possible. So I derived the Jacobi for the visual factors again:

    3) From the above derivation the pseudorange and Doppler residuals were written and the state quantities were written, but the Jacobi has not been derived:

# Pre-Chinese New Year Plan
1. Complete the derivation of the Jacobian and covariance formulas: Derivation of Jacobi and covariance formulas for pseudorange and Doppler residuals of laser position in LVI-SAM to be completed as quickly as possible.
    1) Pseudorange Jacobian
    2) Pseudorange covariance
    3) Doppler Jacobian
    4) Doppler covariance
2. Finish writing the code ceres factor: The derived formulas are written as ceres factors called into the LVI-SAM optimisation function and the code is successfully run.
    1) Pseudorange and Doppler factor .h file
    2) Topics for writing pseudorange and Doppler parameters in GVINS
    3) Replacing the Gaussian Newton method for laser point-to-line and point-to-face in LVI-SAM with ceres least squares method
3. Complete fusion of loosely coupled posturesï¼šIf there is still time left to complete the multi-sensor pose using the loosely coupled approach of vins-fusion.
    1) Bringing out the topic of positional postures posted by different sensors
    2) Loose coupling using methods in vins-fusion
