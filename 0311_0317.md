Lose pose tracking during program execution, I think feature points have invariance in the pool.

Low accuracy leads Perhaps to being unable to perform loop detection.

## [SuperGlue: Learning Feature Matching with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11763)
### (15/03/2024 - 16/03/2024)
### Related work
1. Local feature matching
    1) traditional methods
    2) CNNs: ignore the assignment structure and discard visual information → GNN
2. Graph matching
3. Deep learning for sets: Attention can perform both global and datadependent local aggregation by focusing on specific elements and attributes, and is thus more flexible.
### The SuperGlue Architecture
1. Attentional Graph Neural Network
    1) Keypoint Encoder
    2) Multiplex Graph Neural Network: 
        * Intra-image edges: Connect keypoints i to all other keypoints within the same image.
        * Inter-image edges: Connect keypoints i to all keypoints in the other image.
    3) Attention Aggregation
2. Optimal matching layer: Produces a partial assignment matrix
    1) Score Prediction
    2) Occlusion and Visibility: Augment each set with a dustbin so that unmatched keypoints are explicitly assigned to it.
    3) Sinkhorn Algorithm: The solution of the above optimization problem corresponds to the optimal transport between discrete distributions a and b with scores S.

### (15/03/2024 - 16/03/2024)
### INTRODUCTION
1. The feature point method will have poor extraction effect in weak texture scenes like corridors, white walls, corridors, etc., and may even be impossible to track.
2. Line features are more stable for scenes like weak texture environments, wide viewing angle ranges, and motion blur, and can provide more geometric structure information.
### LINE FEATURE EXTRACTION AND PARAMETER 
1. Improved EDLines line feature extraction algorithm
    * Let the set of line segments extracted by the EDLines algorithm be L , sort L in descending order of length.
    * The length of the shortest line segment in EDLines is determined by NFA.
    * the line segments li lj are the two approximate line segments that need to be merged.
    * Add to the candidate line segment set Lϖ, choose the two farthest endpoints among the first and last endpoints as the first and last endpoints of the new line segment.
    * Keep repeating the above operation until no line segments are eliminated or merged.
2. Line frature parameterization
### contribution
Propose a novel line feature extraction algorithm.

### INTRODUCTION

![1.jpg](https://github.com/zhangx297/2024-Weekly-Report/blob/main/Pictures%20of%20papers/A%20Very%20Fast%20and%20Robust%20Method%20for%20Refinement%20of%20Putative%20Matches%20of%20Features%20in%20MIS%20Images%20for%20Robotic-Assisted%20Surgery_1.png)

2. FMR algorithm – Stage 2: We examine the similarity of the displacement vector of each such feature point with a Gaussian weighted average of the displacement vectors of the neighboring feature points whose status was established to be True in stage 1 of the proposed FMR in a neighborhood larger than that given by the circle of radius.
