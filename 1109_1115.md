2. Lidar-Inertial-Visual Slam
    1) IMU Preintegration
    2) LiDAR Odometry: With this association established, the distances between the extracted features in the scan and corresponding points in the map can be calculated 
    3) Visual Odometry
3. Degeneracy Detection of LiDAR Odometry
    1) Eigenvalues of H are utilized to detect degeneracy, where d1, d2, and d3 denote the most degenerate DOFs. 
    2) The Chi-squared test is a statistical test assessing two categorical variables are critically associated.
    3) employ the status buffer method, which prevents the status from changing radically.

4. Failure Detection of Visual Odometry: The number of tracked features, bias changes, and positional/rotational changes between consecutive keyframes are used for failure detection. 
5. Scan-to-Map Matching
    1) When the state of LiDAR odometry is degenerate in at least one DOF and visual odometry does not fail, the optimization process is remapped by fusing visual and LiDAR odometry in a tightly coupled way
    2) The entire processes in the switching node are described in Algorithm 1.

### Method
1. Bounded Rectification for Corner Detection: propose a key enhancement called Bounded Rectification which not only improves the corner quality but also improves the metric accuracy of Jetson-SLAM significantly.

2. GPU Fundamentals: streaming multiprocessors (SM), memory access cost (MAC)
3. Pyramidal Culling and Aggregation (PyCA)
    1) Feature Culling (FC)
        * Vertical Feature Culling: Multi-Location Per Thread (MLPT)
        * Horizontal Feature Culling0
        * Thread Efficient Warp-Allocation (TEWA)
    2) Pyramidal Feature Aggregation (PFA)

### (15/11/2024)
### Method
1. PREINTEGRATION MERGING THEORY
    1) Preliminaries: Present concepts related to preintegration.
    2) Preintegrated Terms Merging: According to the definition of the preintegrated terms between keyframes, the equation for merging the preintegrated terms between three consecutive keyframes at time i, j and s
    3) Preintegrated Noise Covariance Merging
    4) Preintegrated Jacobians Merging: Use a first-order expansion to update the preintegrated terms.

# code
### (11/11/2024 - 12/11/2024)
1. Build GLVI-fusion: There is a bug that featureExtraction.cpp is an abnormality when I fixed codes of GLVI-fusion.
GLVI: Construct a system of GLVI-SAM → Plan construction code by reading related code → Modify codes → Solve Problems of timestamps of datasets → Experiments of datasets.
