### (02/05/2024 - 03/05/2024)
### Method
1. NOTATION AND DEFINITIONS
    1) Frames: Sensor frame, Local world frame, Earth-centered, Earth-fixed (ECEF) frame, ENU frame, Earth-centered inertial (ECI) frame
    2) Code Pseudorange Measurement: By multiplying the ToF with the speed of light, the receiver obtains the code pseudorange measurement.
    3) Doppler Measurement: The Doppler frequency shift is measured from the difference between the received carrier signal and the designed one, and it reflects the receiverâ€“satellite relative motion along the signal propagation path.
    4) SPP Algorithm: The SPP algorithm utilizes code pseudorange measurements to determine the three-DoF global position of the GNSS receiver via trilateration.
2. PROBABILISTIC FORMULATION
    1) Maximum a Posteriori Estimation
    2) Inertial Factor
    3) Visual Factor
    4) Code Pseudorange Factor
    5) Doppler Factor
    6) Receiver Clock Factors
3. GNSS INITIALIZATION AND DEGENERATION
    1) Initialization
    2) Yaw Offset Calibration
    3) Anchor Point Refinement
