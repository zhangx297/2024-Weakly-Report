## [Leg-KILO: Robust Kinematic-Inertial-Lidar Odometry for Dynamic Legged Robot](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631676)
### (20/10/2024)
### METHODS
1. LEG ODOMETRY
1) Filter State Definition
2) System Kinematics
3) State Prediction
4) Measurements
    * Foot Velocity Measurement
    * Foot Position Measurement
    * Contact Height Measurement
    * IMU Meaturement
5) Residual and Update
2. LIDAR ODOMETRY
1) Adaptive Scan Slicing and Splicing: The paper propose an adaptive scan slicing and splicing method to alleviate the affects of high-dynamic motion for legged robots.
2) Odometry and Mapping: According to the initial guess provided by leg odometry, the extractedfeatures will perform point-to-line Φl and point-to-plane Φp residual calculations with the corresponding features of the local map Pmap

1. How to construct a system of GLVI-SAM.

2. Previously I merged LVI-SAM and liorf to from GLVI-SAM. This week when I checked the GLVI-SAM code in the mapOptmization.cc, I found questions about code differences with source code LVI-SAM. So I run GLVI-SAM using the handheld.bag, which occurs with insufficient accuracy.

Construct a system of GLVI-SAM → Plan construction code by reading related code → Modify codes → Solve Problems of timestamps of datasets → Experiments of datasets.

2. Research 3D Reconstruction papers about Intraoral, MIS, and Deformable.
3. Run an experiment on the tooth dataset with Hao Fu
Feature matching of the source dataset of teeth → Run NeRF-SLAM / sfm codes using public datasets   


# Summary
1. Read a paper about SLAM.
2. Have some questions running GLVI. 
3. Research papers and help Hao Fu to finish codes about NeRF-SLAM.
# Plan
1. Modify codes → Solve Problems of timestamps of datasets → Experiments of datasets
2. Feature matching of the source dataset of teeth → Run NeRF-SLAM / sfm codes using public datasets   
# Problem
1. Code questions of GLVI
