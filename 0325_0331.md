## [PDLC-LIO: A Precise and Direct SLAM System Toward Large-Scale Environments With Loop Closures](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234608)
### (31/03/2024 - 31/03/2024)
### METHODS
1. The Application of Loop Closure Detection in SLAM: The Normal Distributions Transform algorithm is chosen as the odometry mechanism in the proposed system.  
2. Fusion Loop Closure Detection: Use LiDAR-Iris of the point cloudâ€™s extended bird-eye vision.

## [R2DIO: A Robust and Real-Time Depth-Inertial Odometry Leveraging Multimodal Constraints for Challenging Environments](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268066/)
### (31/03/2024 - 31/03/2024)
### METHODS
1. Feature Extraction and Alignment: To mitigate no structural features issue, lines from RGB images are utilized, which we refer to as pseudo 3-D lines. Use k-d tree features matching of scan-to-map and apply the feature DC constraint.

# Summary
1. Finished almost Undergraduate Graduation Project.
2. Read papers about feature matching. 
3. Review the recent papers and knowledge.
# Plan 
1. Read papers about feature matching.
2. Write the IMU-aided codes relying on VINS-Mono and ORBSLAM3. Should I use ROS or CMAKE?  
# Problem
1. Although read amounts of papers, I have not idea about the of feature tracking. The reasons may be a lack of code experiments or several papers.
