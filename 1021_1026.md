1. Code optimisation: Modification of GLVI code to integrate LVI into an optimised system
Construct a system of GLVI-SAM → Plan construction code by reading related code → Modify codes → Solve Problems of timestamps of datasets → Experiments of datasets.

### (22/10/2024-25/10/2024)
1. Reinstallation of the system: Due to the mistaken deletion of the /usr/share folder led to the system can not be used, and finally reinstalled the ubuntu20.04 system environment.
2. Sfm demo: Run GLOMAP with public data and get the resultant plot.

3. Camera calibration: Access to calibration related knowledge in the form of a folder and run calibration with Fu Hao Zhang Zhengyou.
4. Minhang District business trip to complete sensor calibration.   

Feature matching of the source dataset of teeth → Run NeRF-SLAM / sfm codes using public datasets    

# Summary
1. Read a paper about SLAM.
2. Have some questions running GLVI. 
3. Research papers and help Hao Fu to finish codes about NeRF-SLAM.  
# Plan
1. Modify codes → Solve Problems of timestamps of datasets → Experiments of datasets  
2. Feature matching of the source dataset of teeth → Run NeRF-SLAM / sfm codes using public datasets   
# Problem
1. Code questions of GLVI
