1. Build GLVI-fusion: The dataset ambiguity problem caused by the sensor calibration in LVI-SAM was fixed and GLVI was built. but when the accuracy analysis of GLVI was performed, it was found that the RMSE was 7m, however, it was only 4.9m in the LVI-SAM experiments, which was found to be due to large fluctuations in the z-axis by comparison. After that the GPS optimisation factor was turned on and the accuracy could reach 3m, but the experiment in the thesis was only 0.8m.
GLVI: Construct a system of GLVI-SAM → Plan construction code by reading related code → Modify codes → Solve Problems of timestamps of datasets → Experiments of datasets.
