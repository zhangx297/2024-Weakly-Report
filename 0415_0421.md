## [Detector-Free Structure from Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15669)
### (14/04/2024 - 15/04/2024)
### METHOD
1. Detector-Free Matching and Coarse SfM: The quantization step forces multiple subpixel matches that are close to each other to merge into a single grid node, which improves consistency. After the match quantization, we utilize these coarse matches for incremental mapping to obtain a coarse SfM model.
2. Iterative SfM Refinement:
    1) Feature Track Refinement: The basic idea is to locally adjust the keypoint locations in all views so that the correlation among their features is maximized.
        * Reference View Selection
        * Multi-View Feature Transformer
        * Training
    2) Geometry Refinement: The geometry refinement pipeline iteratively refines the poses, in trinsics, point clouds, as well as topology of feature tracks.

### (15/04/2024 - 16/04/2024)
### METHOD
1. ICP
    1) Compute correspondences between the two scans.
    2) Compute a transformation which minimizes distance between corresponding points.

2. GENERALIZED-ICP: 
    1) Generalized-ICP is based on attaching a probabilistic model to the minimization step on line 11 of Alg. 1.

## [SiLVR_Scalable Lidar-Visual Reconstruction with Neural Radiance Fields for Robotic Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06877)
### (18/04/2024 - 19/04/2024)
### METHOD
1. NeRF-based Scene Representation
2. Geometric Constraints from Lidar Measurements: Impose a lidar-based depth regularisation by adding a depth loss defined as the KLDivergence between a normal distribution around the lidar depth-measurement D and the rendered ray distribution h(t) from the NeRF model.
3. Bootstrapping Camera Poses from SLAM with scale: Use the SLAM poses as a pose prior and refine the trajectory using COLMAP. Specifically, we replace the COLMAP mapper with point triangulator which reads prior poses.
4. Scaling NeRF with Submapping: Identify regions with low surface density and remove them when merging submap clouds to get the final reconstruction.

### (19/04/2024 - 20/04/2024)
### METHOD
1. Pure Visual SLAM: Obtain the initial keyframe poses from stereo visual-only SLAM.
2. Eigenvalue-based Gyroscope Bias Estimator: Derive the initial gyroscope bias by formulating an eigenvalue minimization problem using both visual, and gyroscope measurements.

# Summary
1. Read papers for the second time.
2. Read papers about NeRF and SLAM. 
3. Compile codes about NeRF and Orbeez-SLAM (having bugs in the Ziqiang 5000 server).
4. Write codes for the stereo model and triangulation.
# Plan 
1. Compile codes about Orbeez-SLAM in the server.
2. Read papers about SLAM, NeRF, and the second reading papers.
3. Write a PowerPoint for the Coordinated Navigation and Positioning Project.
# Problem
1. The Ziqiang5000 server does not download applications by using apt-get/apt, for which I must find the source code to download cmake and other software. So I need time to configure related environments about SLAM.
